### The Feeds

ClipCanvas organizes your media into three distinct feeds, which you can switch between using the buttons at the top of the screen when in the video player view.

* **Social Feed:** This is the default feed, pre-loaded with sample videos to demonstrate the player's functionality.
* **Local Feed:** This feed contains all the video and image files you have personally added to the ClipCanvas library.
* **Folder Feed:** This powerful feature allows you to select a folder from your computer. ClipCanvas will then scan it for compatible video files and let you play them directly without adding them to your library. This is perfect for browsing through folders of media quickly.

### The Video Player

The video player is the heart of ClipCanvas and is packed with features.

* **Ambient Mode:** Creates a blurred, colorful background based on the current video for a more immersive experience.
* **Lock Mode:** Prevents accidental touches and hides the UI, perfect for uninterrupted viewing.
* **Rotation:** Rotates the video by 90-degree increments.
* **Zoom & Pan:** Zoom into the video up to 3x and pan around to focus on details.
* **Double-Tap to Seek:** Double-tapping on the left or right side of the video will seek backward or forward by 10 seconds.
* **Controls:** All standard controls are available, including play/pause, fullscreen, and access to playlists.

### The Gallery View

The Gallery is the default home screen. It shows thumbnails for all media across your library. You can click on any video thumbnail to start playing it in the video player or click on an image to view it in a full-screen overlay.
